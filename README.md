Java lab programs, both part A and part B. 

For the GUI program of part B, we have to create a directory and make a txt file in that directory and write the 
ID, Name, DOJ, DOB etc in that file.
Now give the math in this line:  File fileobj=new File("................./file.txt");

After that when you run the program, in the popped UI enter the same details as in file.txt.
The output can se seen in the console.

For the first program of part B i.e., employee program, before running go to RUN CONFIGURATIONS->ARGUMENTS->PROGRAM ARGUMENTS 
& give only the employee id mentioned in the program and the apply and run.
